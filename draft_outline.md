# Simplifying Assumptions

## Classification Task
(or rank ordering task)

## short, practical, introductory

## talking about text data here 


# 1: What does your boss care about? 

## Pure Prediction?

## Inference or Analysis?


# 2: What does your structured data look like?

## How much of it you got?

## Sparse? Dense?


# 3: What does your corpus look like?

## How much of it you got?

## What's the link?
- classifying authors?
- classifying object of discussion?
- single "documents" per link vs hierarchical corpus?

## Got labels?
- For all documents?
- For some authors for some documents?

## There is some there there...

# Last question: Model evaluation? 

## How do you feel about p-values?

# Preprocessing Your Text

## bag-of-ngrams

## chunking

## some nifty tools

# Prediction-focused Methods

## Kitchen Sink Approach
- pro: Objective Function? What Objective Function?
- con: Depending on your role, often it isn't enough to just predict well.
- con: People are suspicious of the black box.

## Dimensionality Reduction

## Clustering

# Inference-focused Methods

## Manually generated derivative features 
- pro: easy to explain/interpret
- con: potentially the path to madness

## Full Generative Model
- pro: you wrote a dissertation without the fuss of getting a PHd
- con: you probably don't work there anymore, as it is now fifteen years later

# I like a nice blend...

## Feature Learning
- Some unsupervised or semisupervised work with the text data

## Using the results as features in my core mode - represented in a way that propagates the uncertainty. 

# Things to watch out 

## so what do these p-values even mean now?

# Other stuff
